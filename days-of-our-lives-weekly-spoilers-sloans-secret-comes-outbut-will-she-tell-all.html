EJ can barely believe what he is hearing as Leo tells him all about Dimitri Von Leuchner needing legal help and dropping Nicole Walker’s (Arianne Zucker) baby off thinking she’d bring him to the hospital.</p><p>EJ heads straight for Eric and Sloan’s place and accuses her of kidnapping his son and keeping him for all of these months and Sloan isn’t sure what to do.</p><p>Will she use her own knowledge that she switched the DNA tests to make it seem like EJ was the father of Nicole’s baby? Could she convince EJ to keep her secret so that they both hold onto the people they claim to love who also happen to be Jude’s biological parents?</p><p><img alt="Days Of Our Lives: EJ DiMera (Daniel Feuerriegel)" width=730 height=389 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2024/04/days-of-our-lives-weekly-spoilers-sloans-secret-comes-outbut-will-she-tell-all/ data-jpibfi-post-title="Days of our Lives Weekly Spoilers: Sloan’s Secret Comes Out…But Will She Tell All?" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/DOOL-EJ-Dimera-1.png></p><h3>What Has Paulina Done?</h3><p><a href=#>Last week, Chanel Dupree (Raven Bowens) was given the all-clear</a> to go home and feel radiation-free after her ordeal in the snow. This week, she is rushed to the hospital and told that she has radiation poisoning. Guess those tests were wrong the last time.</p><p>Paulina Price Carver (Jackee Harry) knows this is her fault because she didn’t follow doctors’ orders. She was told she was radioactive and dangerous but she didn’t listen and had to venture out to Smith Island to rescue Chanel in the snow. It seemed like a cartoon to viewers and now it has consequences.</p><h3>Other Salem Happenings</h3><p><a href=#>Thomas DiMera (Carey Christopher) finally returned that tarot card</a> to Konstantin (John Kapelos) — and that means more trouble for John Black (Drake Hogestyn).</p><p>Konstantin uses the card to activate The Pawn and now John has to do Konstantin’s bidding. He already had Theresa Donovan (Emily O’Brien) under his thumb.</p><p>Wendy Shin (Victoria Grace) and Tripp Johnson (Lucas Adams) really do bid farewell to Salem this week. Does that mean that Ava Vitali (Tamara Braun) and Harris Michaels (Steve Burton) can move into their apartment?</p><p>Stream new episodes of Days of our Lives weekdays on<a href=# rel=noopener> Peacock starting at 6 AM EST to see how these stories play out.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX91e49tZp2Zqah6sLKMqKyrZZyew6a%2FjLCcnqOcrnq0vM6io56qo2LArbvAp6pmq5WYv6bAjJympp2jYry2wMGuq2avmaG5br%2FHnmStnZyheqK4y2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
