He had <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">celebrated his 18th birthday </a>a week before shooting elementary <a href=#>school kids</a>. Those who knew him described him as an anti-social person who was bullied and had no friends.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION:</strong> Never miss breaking news – <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">join</a> Briefly News' Telegram channel!</p><h3>Salvador Ramos’ personal life</h3><p class=align-left>Authorities confirmed that he had no prior criminal record and resided with his grandparents while studying at Uvalde High School. A former classmate revealed that he had stopped attending class regularly. He reportedly went on his shooting spree after having an argument with his grandma a day after his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">classmates graduated</a>, and he did not.</p><p class=align-left>Little is known regarding Salvador Ramos' parents. His neighbour, Ruben Flores, said the boy did not have a great relationship with his mother, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">they argued a lot</a> which prompted him to start living with his grandparents.</p><p class=align-left>The shooter was also known for getting into <a href=#>physical fights </a>with others. People used to make fun of his clothing and his financially unstable family. Salvador worked the day shift at a local Wendy's restaurant, and the manager confirmed that he was a quiet person but would sometimes get aggressive, especially towards female employees.</p><h3>Salvador Ramos’ school shooting</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/ab31da0321ec4fe6.jpg><p class=align-left>The 18-year-old <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">teenager shot and killed</a> 19 children and two teachers at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, United States. About 17 people were wounded in the incident. He was at the facility for about one hour before the authorities arrived and killed him.</p><p class=align-left>The authorities revealed that before the Uvalde cold-shooting, he had shot his grandmother and escaped in a truck. A neighbour heard the shots and called 911. His grandma was hospitalized and is now in critical condition.</p><p class=align-left>The teenager had earlier communicated his plans via social media. He had posted photos of his <a href=#>assault rifles</a> on his Instagram, which have since been taken down. He later revealed that he was going to shoot his grandmother and later sent updates after shooting her. Ramos also sent a Facebook message saying he was going to shoot an elementary school a few minutes before arriving at Robb Elementary.</p><h3>Salvador Ramos' assault rifles</h3><p class=align-left>The authorities confirmed that the teenager had legally bought himself two AR platform rifles at a Uvalde <a href=#>federal firearms</a> licensee on May 17th and May 20th. He also bought 375 rounds of ammunition on May 18th. The purchases were presents for his 18th birthday.</p><p class=align-left>Salvador Ramos' heartless mass killing of innocent people is saddening and horrifying. The increasing number of mass shootings and suicide cases done by young people is a concerning issue that needs to be tackled. The problem can easily be blamed on lenient gun laws and mental health, but how is society failing in raising the next generation?</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong><a href=#>Who is Noah Beck?
