With her mom calling her an “adorer of all things pretty,” the only daughter of Zach and Tori has always had a fondness for style and elegance. From the moment she was tiny, she’s been drawn to pretty things and as she’s grown older, she’s become a little fashionista. This week, she looked stunning in an adorable princess gown.</p><p><span>Lilah Roloff From Little People Big World Rocks Her Style</span></p><p>Tori and Zach Roloff’s daughter Lilah is one of the cutest little girls, TLC fans agree. Actually, her mom selects her outfits, but Lilah knows how to look happy when her mom hits the right note. Special occasions see Lilah in really nice outfits. In fact, TLC fans adored her Fourth<a href=#> of July dress.</a> It was white with flags around her collar, and she looked cute and sophisticated. However, she has also been seen sporting an outfit covered in cartoon chicken characters.</p><p>Little People, Big World fans often see Jackson’s little sister, Lilah Roloff <a href=#>at dance class these days</a>. There, she rocks some gorgeous outfits. Actually, she is becoming increasingly cute and she has poise and appeal. This week, her outfits might have been inspired by a recent trip to Disney. You might recall that her cousin Ember was keen to see the Princesses at the theme park. Perhaps Tori’s daughter told her about them. But she could have just traveled to Washington to see a regal royal tiny tot.</p><h3>Lilah Roloff Dresses In Royal Blue For A Mom Date</h3><p>With her hair adorned with a bow, Lilah Roloff smiled so sweetly for the camera when her mom Tori shared a photo of her this week, saying that she was ready for a “mama Lilah date.” The little fashionista wore a gorgeous blue princess outfit, with her little white sneakers peeping out from underneath. Holding two dolls in her arms, she certainly would have won if she had walked down a red carpet! Meanwhile, her proud mom dressed all in black, letting the spotlight shine on Lilah.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Lilah-Roloff.jpg><p>Lilah Roloff later posed over a floor vent wearing an Encanto-themed skirt. Of course, Disney is famous for Encanto. In that post, her mom wrote, “Marilyn moment.” Of course, she referenced Marlyn Monroe’s famous photo standing over an air vent.</p><p><img alt="Little People Big World Lilah Roloff" width=450 height=722 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2023/04/royal-dreams-lilah-roloff-stuns-in-a-pretty-blue-princess-gown/ data-jpibfi-post-title="Royal Dreams: Lilah Roloff Stuns In A Pretty Blue Princess Gown" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Little-People-Big-World-Lilah-Roloff.jpg></p><p>Chock-full of cuteness, this little TLC star must really melt her Mama’s heart. Unfortunately, Toir didn’t post it on her main Instagram profile page. So, there are no comments to share. However, we’re willing to bet that Tori got plenty of DMs about her cute daughter.</p><h3>Will The LPBW Staret Need Eye Surgery?</h3><p>Lilah Roloff wore her eyeglasses in her princess dress. However, in the Marilyn photo, she didn’t. TLC fans often worry that if she doesn’t wear them, she might need corrective eye surgery. Perhaps that will be covered in the next season of the show. For now, fans can enjoy seeing the LPBW starlet doing what she does best: looking cute as a bean!</p><p>Be sure to catch up on everything happening with LPBW right now.
