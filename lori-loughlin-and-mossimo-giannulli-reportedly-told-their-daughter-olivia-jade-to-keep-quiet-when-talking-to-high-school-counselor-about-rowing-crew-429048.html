Prosecutors wrote in new court documents that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Giannulli</a> had allegedly confronted the counselor after he claimed Olivia was probably not on the crew team.</p><p>Her guidance counselor reportedly said to an admissions officer that based on her “video blogging schedule,” it was unlikely she had time to row crew. Reportedly, Giannulli asked the counselor why he was getting involved with his daughter’s admission into the school.</p><p>The filing also says Giannulli “bluntly stated that his younger daughter was a coxswain.” According to Page Six, the court filing regarding the celebrity couple was submitted by Andrew Leling, the US Attorney.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CEFg3XJpd1S/</p><p>Lori and Mossimo are currently getting ready for their sentencing on Friday. As it was previously reported, Lori and Mossimo have been accused of paying half-a-million dollars in bribes for their pair of daughters to get into USC.</p><p>Prosecutors wrote in their statement that what the couple did – trying to pass their daughters off as rowing athletes to get into a prestigious university – was “serious.” The prosecutor claims Lori and Mossimo had made their daughters pose as athletes to get them into the school.</p><p>The filing also reports that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Lori and Mossimo</a> had told Jade, who was 18-years-old at the time, how to avoid speaking with the high school adviser so as not to reveal what they were up to. Followers of the case know it’s not looking good for the celebrity couple.</p><p>Near the beginning of the year, the federal prosecutor revealed photos in which Olivia and Isabella were seated on rowing machines as if they were crew athletes. In their defense, Lori and Mossimo have alleged they were duped into believing they were offering legitimate donations to Singer.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Thus far, reports have indicated that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Loughlin may have to serve two months behind bars while her husband will serve five</a>, in addition to hefty fines.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGecpL%2BqecuorKCgnJ67bq3NnWSmp6Ootq67jKCgmqaeqrmttYyrnKmnoqmypbjYZquopJRiwamxyKtknZmlnLW1sdFmpqWhpp6ubrbAnZxmrJ9iuKaxz2aorqGVqXq4tMSnZK2ZnKC2r7OMraZmoJmctW6%2FwqGmqKRdmLy2utKeo6iqXZavsMHTZqmor5mjtG6v0Z6uZmxibn11hI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
