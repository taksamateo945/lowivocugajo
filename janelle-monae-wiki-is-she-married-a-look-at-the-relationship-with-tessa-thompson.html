Monáe got the ASCAP Vanguard Award and an MTV Video Music Award in 2010.</p><p>In addition, Monáe was named Trailblazer of the Year in 2018 and Billboard Women in Music Rising Star in 2015. Monáe became a CoverGirl ambassador in 2012. Boston City Council declared October 16, 2013, as “Janelle Monáe Day” in celebration of Janelle Monáe’s creative skill and advocacy.

Monáe’s younger sister, Kimmy, is the product of her mother’s second marriage.</p><h2>Is Janelle Monáe’s Married?</h2><p><strong>Janelle Monae</strong> is known for keeping her personal life secret, although she has revealed a few details about her sexuality. During a 2018 interview with RollingStone, Monae revealed that she is pansexual.&nbsp;She went on to say that, although she had previously identified as bisexual, she eventually recognized that pansexuality was a more true description of her sexual orientation. In an interview with Sway in the Morning, Janelle previously indicated that she didn’t care about a person’s sexual orientation as long as there was love.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Janelle-Monae-2.jpg alt="Janelle Monáe" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Janelle tweeted #IAmNonBinary in January 2020, and people were understandably intrigued as to what she meant. TheCut spoke with Monae on the meaning of her massively shared tweet. Monae explained her intention to raise public awareness of the community.</p><h2>Janelle Monáe and Tessa Thompson’s Relationship Timeline</h2><p>Rumors about Tessa and Janelle’s romance started to circulate when Tessa made a quick cameo appearance in Monae’s yoga video.&nbsp;Following that, the pair began traveling and attending award ceremonies together. Tessa then played Janelle’s lover in the sensual 2018 music video for Pynk. Thompson then revealed that she is bisexual after Janelle said that she is pansexual.</p><p>Thompson said the following about her connection with Monae in an interview with Net-a-Porter.&nbsp;“We have a special bond.” Because we are so close, we vibrate at the same frequency. It’s OK if others have preconceived notions about who or what we are. It doesn’t concern me.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Janelle-Monae.jpg alt="Janelle Monáe" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Most people accepted Tessa’s claim that she was dating Monae. Thompson explained the matter on Twitter, saying, “I didn’t state that I was in a relationship.”&nbsp;Tessa subsequently described herself and Monae as “women free of fixed identities and sexualities” in an interview with The Cut.&nbsp;She did not, however, declare unequivocally if she was dating Monae. Although there have been persistent rumors of a connection between the two, we can never be certain unless they announce it.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGihmqaVobmmecyopZqdXay2rLWMoqpmq5iaeq6t0augnpxdlnqtu86kZJqsXam1pnnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlksKGknXq1sdKsmGasmKS6sb%2FOp2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
