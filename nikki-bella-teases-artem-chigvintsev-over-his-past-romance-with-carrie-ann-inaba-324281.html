That being said, when the pair helped co-host Entertainment Tonight yesterday, Nikki took this opportunity to shade her man for his romance with Carrie Ann Inaba.</p><p>It was all in good fun, of course! As they were chatting about their lives, Nikki could not help but tease Artem.</p><p>They also discussed their time on Dancing with the Stars, where they met in 2017, as well as their relationship.</p><p>When Inaba was brought into discussion, since she is a judge on DWTS, Nikki recalled that he used to date her,</p><p>Referring to the new voting system on the dancing competition, Nikki said: ‘I like it. I think we would have lasted longer if we had that option. I think Carrie Ann totally would have saved us. And not because you guys dated… but she really liked my technique!’</p><p>Artem got really embarrassed and his face turned red to the point that he picked up a paper and covered his face with it.</p><p>‘Speaking of hot seat today, what? C’mon!’ he exclaimed.</p><p>The exes’ romance lasted for no less than two and a half years so it was pretty serious.</p><p>They met in 2006 on So You Think You Can Dance and broke up in 2009 so it’s been a while but, obviously, Nikki has not forgotten.</p><p>Artem also opened up about not being on season 28 of DWTS.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘I feel like I’m better now. The best way to describe [the feeling] is, having this relationship for 10 years that you’ve completely invested in, and all of a sudden, it’s just like it’s not there anymore. So, it’s tough, but I wish the best of luck to the show,’ he said.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeenristYybnKWkkWLBpq3SnqpmmaKpsq55wqGgoK6Zo8G0sdVmpq%2BdomK1qr%2BMqZisrF2nvK6tzZycZq%2BZqbVur8CrqaKdXZa7r3nIp5ibmV1of3V%2Bl2pm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
