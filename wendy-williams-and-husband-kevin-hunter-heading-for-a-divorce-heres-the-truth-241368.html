But is it really true or not?</p><p>One insider close to Wendy Williams and her hubby chatted with HollywoodLife, telling the outlet if they are truly separating or not.</p><p>‘There is no truth at all to the separation rumors swirling around Wendy and her husband Kevin. Wendy and Kevin have been together a very long time, they have longevity on their side with over 22 years married. Like any other&nbsp;couple they have had their ups and downs, but&nbsp;they are happy and as strong and solid as ever,’ she source dished.</p><p>Meanwhile, Williams has been absent from her TV show ever since December 20 after suffering a shoulder fracture.</p><p>Later on, it was announced that her break had been extended indefinitely due to some complications of her Graves disease as well!</p><p>Wendy has been dealing with her health problems and now, she is also being stressed out by the speculations that her decades-long marriage might be ending soon.</p><p>This is not the first time the rumors come into the forefront as they have been circulating quite a lot lately.</p><p>The insider tells the site that the pair hasn’t appreciated the rumors about the two of them ending things.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>‘They do not like the split rumors and feel they are nonsense. They have not only a good personal relationship, but a strong business relationship too [Kevin is also Wendy’s manager]. They work well together and have no reason to split. Things are fine with her and Kevin,’ the source close to the apparently happy couple dished.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGenmrulxYywoKWkmZa6tHnAp5tmoKWor6K6w2ainq6Zo3qpwc2tnKtlmJqupbXNoGSfp6Jirm6wyK%2Bmq5uVYrWmvsSsZK2glWLBs8HToWRrbGFog3l7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
