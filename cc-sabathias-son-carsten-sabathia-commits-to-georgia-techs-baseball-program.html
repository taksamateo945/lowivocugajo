The talented athlete has formally committed to Georgia Tech’s baseball program.</p><p>Currently the athletic 18-year-old is a senior at Bergen Catholic High School. Carsten plays first base for his school, which is located in New Jersey.</p><p>“He controls the strike zone,” CC Sabathia told <a href=#>The Athletic</a>’s Lindsey Adler about his son in a recent interview. “He sees more pitches than anybody I’ve ever seen at his age.”</p><p>Carsten Sabathia, of course, spent countless hours in major-league clubhouses watching his father on the baseball field. CC Sabathia, a 2009 World Series winner, played 19 seasons, primarily with the New York Yankees. He also played during his career for MLB teams Cleveland Indians and Milwaukee Brewers. A unique fun-fact about CC Sabathia is that he batted and threw left-handed and also was honored with the coveted Al Cy Young award in 2007.</p><p>Carsten is also following in his father’s amazing footsteps. He showed off his skills for scouts and fans at the Perfect Game All-American Class in August 2021. The Perfect Game All-American is a national showcase for top high school prospects.</p><p>And of course, Carsten is extremely proud that he will now be a member of the Georgia Tech program. He posted on the official <a href=#>Uninterrupted Instagram</a> social media page saying that he is, “Grateful for this moment, humble for the opportunity & ready to carry on the #LegaCCy! Let’s get to work!” Uninterrupted is an athlete empowerment brand founded by @kingjames & @mavcarter.</p><p>The Georgia Tech program touts some amazing stats when it comes to wins and more. The program has won nine ACC championships and recorded three College World Series appearances.</p><p>Congratulations, Carsten! We will be watching and cheering you on from the stands! We cannot wait to see what the future holds for you and which MLB team you will eventually call home.</p><p>Photos: Photo courtesy of Georgia Tech</p><p><span class="post-views-icon dashicons dashicons-chart-bar"></span><br><span class=post-views-label>Post Views:</span><br><span class=post-views-count>185</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOnJpmq5GXrrW0yJqqZqufo3qkrdGsq56mXaiuo63ToaCaZZOkuq6106xkraddnLKwvsaimGaslZi1tHnBmqqempGhuW680aieq5mdZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
