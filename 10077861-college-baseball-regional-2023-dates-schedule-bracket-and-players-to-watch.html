The opening matchups pit the No. 1 and No. 4 seeds against each other, as well as the No. 2 and No. 3 seeds. Each bracket follows a double-elimination format.</p><p>The 16 teams that advance to next weekend's super regional round could need as few as three wins to advance, though some may require four or five depending on losses.</p><p><b><u>Players to Watch</u></b></p><p><b>Dylan Crews, OF and Paul Skenes, P, LSU</b></p><p>Two of the top prospects in the 2023 MLB draft play on the same team.</p><p>Outfielder Dylan Crews and right-handed pitcher Paul Skenes have drawn countless MLB scouts to Alex Box Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and many more will be there this weekend. Both are consensus top-five selections.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Kiley McDaniel</a> of ESPN.com has Crews at No. 2 and Skenes at No. 5 in his latest mock draft, while <a href=# rel=noopener>Keith Law</a> of The Athletic has them going at No. 1 and No. 2, respectively.</p><p>Crews enters the NCAA tournament with a .420 batting average, 1.277 OPS, 15 home runs and 59 RBI. He could do a lot of damage to the pitching staffs of Tulane, Sam Houston State and Oregon State during regional weekend.</p><p>Skenes leads the nation in strikeouts by a wide margin. He fanned 167 batters. The next closest pitcher in that category has 125 punchouts.</p><p>Crews and Skenes can only add to their MLB draft hype with good performances this weekend, which LSU hopes will end with a home super regional.</p><p><b>Wyatt Langford, OF, Florida</b></p><p>Wyatt Langford comes into the Gainesville regional with a better OPS than Crews.</p><p>The Florida outfielder has a 1.343 OPS with 17 home runs, 43 RBI and a .398 batting average.</p><p>The 21-year-old is viewed as the other consensus top-five pick to come out of the SEC. McDaniel has him going at No. 3, while Law mocked him to No. 5.</p><p>Langford and the Gators are the No. 2 overall seed in the 64-team bracket, while the Wake Forest Demon Deacons are No. 1.</p><p>Despite that honor, the Gators face a tough regional that includes Texas Tech and UConn. Florida A&M is the fourth team in that part of the bracket.</p><p>Langford's bat should be on display all weekend, as the Gators try to power their way into a home super regional.</p><p>A strong set of performances throughout Florida's likely deep run should help solidify Langford's place in the top five for the July 9 draft.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ2yFd32MnKalpJWcsm6uwKycm5mcoXqzscaipqeZnGJ%2FcX6SZpuarJWoerSvx56brqSVYq%2BzrcKknK1lkaOxbrzLmrCeqqNiwbB51pqrnKA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
