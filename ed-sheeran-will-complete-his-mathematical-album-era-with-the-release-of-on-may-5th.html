Fans can pre-order the soon-to-be hit album <a href=# rel=noopener>HERE</a>.</p><p>According Sheeran’s extremely heartfelt <a href=#>Instagram post</a>,&nbsp;“I had been working on – for a decade, trying to sculpt the perfect acoustic album, writing and recording hundreds of songs with a clear vision of what I thought it should be. Then, at the start of 2022, a series of events changed my life, my mental health, and ultimately the way I viewed music and art.”</p><p>The talented singer-songwriter opened up and revealed what this “series of events” truly was, ultimately tugging on our heart strings and teasing that this will be his most genuine, emotional project yet.</p><p>Sheeran shared, “Within the space of a month, my pregnant wife got told she had a tumor, with no route to treatment until after the birth. My best friend Jamal, a brother to me, died suddenly and I found myself standing in court defending my integrity and career as a songwriter. I was spiralling through fear, depression and anxiety.”</p><p align=center>“Writing songs is my therapy. It helps me make sense of my feelings. I wrote without thought of what the songs would be, I just wrote whatever tumbled out. And in just over a week, I replaced a decade’s worth of work with my deepest darkest thoughts,” he revealed.</p><p align=center>“I felt like I was drowning, head below the surface, looking up but not being able to break through for air,” hence the ocean-themed promotion Sheeran has been utilizing for the album.</p><p>After being in the music industry since 2009, it can be inferred that –&nbsp;will serve as a reminder as to why Ed Sheeran is truly most gifted lyricists of his generation, with this feeling of “drowning” relaying to fans through the album’s 14 soon-to-be hit tracks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsecrets.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ED-SHEERAN-SUBTRACT-ALBUM-ARTWORK-scaled.jpg><p>After over ten years, we are SO ready for Ed Sheeran to complete his&nbsp;beloved mathematical album era and continue to show fans who he truly is.
