She was also raised there; having a mixed ancestry, her father hails from Rivers state in Nigeria, while her mother is a Ghanaian. But on a sad note, it is disheartening to know that both her parents are now late. Nevertheless, Tacha completed her primary and secondary school education in Rivers State, before proceeding to the Ignatius Ajuru University of Education, where she earned a degree in English in 2016.</p><p>Despite losing both of her parents, Tacha still strived against all odds to reach her goals in life, and this may have been the major motivation behind her becoming an entrepreneur and the force behind her courageous and bold approach towards life.</p><h2><b>The Former BB Naija Star Wears A Coat of Many Colors</b></h2><p>The self-acclaimed Port Harcourt’s first daughter Tacha has already been a well-established businesswoman and Vlogger even before she got the slot to feature in the Big Brother Naija reality TV show. She has been into the beauty business of make-up. To add to this, Tacha also runs her YouTube channel called <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Symply Tacha</a>, where she also promotes her online fashion brand named “Everything Tacha.”</p><p>She has also been an Instagram influencer, and she often got paid by brands, individuals, and companies to promote their products online. Obviously, Tacha has been doing quite well for herself having several streams of income before her emergence as a Big Brother Naija Housemate.</p><h2><b>Tacha’s Journey Through BB Naija Pepper Dem</b></h2><p>The mention of the name Tacha would instantly spark off memories of the radical, and daring BBNiaja Pepper Dem ex-housemate, whose popularity has gone wild after her eviction from the BBNiaja house resulting from her fighting her fellow housemate Mercy.</p><p>However, many would think that getting into the Big Brother Naija reality show for the Port Harcourt First Daughter was not without much struggle, but the reverse was the case. Though she was very confident about being picked at the first trial, until when her hopes were dashed and she could not make headway to secure a spot in her first attempt at the Port Harcourt BB Naija audition center.</p><p>Notwithstanding, she never let despair creep in or deter her, but she forged amidst such discouragement, and she made another attempt at the Enugu BB Naija audition center which turned out to be positive. She got lucky to be selected among the contestants who would make it to the BB Naija House in the 4th edition, which was tagged <i>Pepper Dem</i>.</p><p>Upon arriving at the Big Brother Naija house, Tasha prides herself as the Port Harcourt First Daughter among her fellow housemates, displaying her self-confidence all the way, and she was also notoriously controversial and quick-tempered. Again, Tacha was fond of showing off her cleavage tattoo, which was an inscription of Nigerian Music superstar <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Davido</a>, the owner of the DMW record label. She later cleared the air on it, stressing that it was her unfading love for Davido that inspired the tattoo, saying that she fell in love with him after hearing his song <i>Dami Duro</i> in 2011.</p><p>From her antecedents within the BB Naija house, Tacha often dominates every controversy, and she was full of herself in the house. As a result, she was able to pull quite a huge fan base to herself, it could be said that she had the highest number of fans both in Nigeria and other African countries, especially Ghana, where her mother hails from. Also, she is the most popular BB Naija housemate in the 4th edition of the reality show.</p><p>Be that as it may, despite Tacha’s popularity in the show, her stay in the BBNaija house became short-lived as she got evicted on the 89th day of the competition after getting into a brawl with her fellow housemate Mercy Eke, owing to the allegation that the latter referred to her as being stupid due to her unguided utterances and misbehaviors within the house.&nbsp;Thus, Tacha allowed her anger and hot temper to get the best part of her as she could not control herself thereby physically assaulting Mercy, and since it is against the rules of the competition for any housemate to engage in any fight, Tacha got herself disqualified and evicted from the house.</p><p>Notwithstanding, her boldness and confidence coupled with her controversial personality in the house won the hearts of her mammoth fans and turned her into a global figure, so much so that after her eviction, she got a whooping cash reward of N100 million from her sympathizing and generous fans who are best known as Tacha Titans. In addition, she was able to use her huge fan base to secure several multi-million naira endorsement deals from big companies.</p><p>However, after leaving the BB Naija house, the Queen of the Titans has risen into a very notable figure and highly influential celebrity, yet she did not relent in her strive for a good life as she still continued with her online and other businesses while exploring new business ideas.</p><h2><b>She Made Her $220,000 Net Worth Through Several Endeavors</b></h2><p>There is no doubt that Tacha’s participation in the BBNaija reality TV show has earned her fame and fortune as it thrust her into the limelight. Albeit, she is also a successful entrepreneur with multiple streams of income.</p><p>In line with this, Tacha earns income from quite a number of money-spinning businesses which include, being a Vlogger and YouTube content creator; she earns from her monetized YouTube channel Symply Tacha. On the platform, she often posts her twerking videos which attract lots of views. Again, she also makes money as an Instagram influencer, promoting her makeup brand <i>everything Tacha</i>, which is an online makeup store where she sells makeup kits and other accessories in addition to selling her personal Power Bank brand, <i>Power Tacha, </i>and her own clippers brand called ST Clippers.</p><p>Being an Instagram influencer, she also earns from promoting other people’s businesses who hope to generate much traffic for their brands or sites. Again, Tacha also controls other offline businesses and makes some bills from guest appearances.</p><p>In addition to all of this, her biggest financial breakthrough came after the BBNiaja exposure where she earned lots of millions. First, she was gifted N100 million by her fans, aside from the many earnings from her several endorsement deals. All of these accumulated to form Tacha’s overall net worth, which has been estimated to be around the threshold of $220,000.</p><p>With these laudable achievements, the BBNaija slay Queen Tacha could be regarded as one of the richest ex-BBNaija housemates. This has afforded her a luxurious lifestyle, as she now owns her own house as well as luxury cars, one of her popular cars is the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Mercedes Benz&nbsp; C300</a>, which was given to her as a gift again by her loyal fans TachaTitans on her 25th birthday.</p><h3><b>Tacha Also Makes Money from Her Endorsement Deals with Top Brands</b></h3><p>As highlighted earlier, the star diva Tacha currently is an ambassador to several big brands in Nigeria. Although the amount she makes from such deals is currently not open to the public, it is believed that she is making a substantial amount from them. She has signed endorsement deals with top brands like:</p><ul><li>House of Lunettes,</li><li>GetFit, Ciroc</li><li>Royal Hair</li><li>Villa Game</li><li>Patricia NG, and</li><li>Oppo, a Chinese mobile tech company.</li></ul><p>In a nutshell, Tacha has remained one of the leading and exceptional Nigerian women who serve as an inspiration to many vulnerable women and girls across the country, encouraging them to replicate her courage, boldness, and unrelenting approach towards the attainment of their life goals.</p><p><strong>Tacha made her wealth through the following ways:</strong></p><ul><li>Vlogging and YouTube Career</li><li>Instagram</li><li>Endorsements</li><li>Everything Tacha</li><li>Other business endeavors.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK57waKmoKqRpbW6ecCnm2amlal6uLvRrZ9mp5Zis7C%2BzJ6pZpqZnHqjvs6tn56qXaOuqrbAZp%2BoraOauqLAxGarmpuYlnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
