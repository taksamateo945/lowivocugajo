The former 19 Kids and Counting star will take part in Bible study, counsel groups, and more during his time at the <a href=#>Reformers Unanimous</a> center in Rockford, Ill.</p><p>As previously reported, last month it was revealed via leaked documents that Duggar had two accounts on the adultery website Ashley Madison. He later admitted to cheating on his wife, <strong>Anna Duggar</strong> — with whom he shares four young children — and checked himself into a long-term treatment center amid the news. The scandal comes three months after he admitted to molesting five underage girls in the past, including his sisters <strong>Jill </strong>and <strong>Jessa Duggar</strong>.</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=412 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Josh and Anna Duggar" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>According to the center’s website, patients seeking help at the religious-based facility begin their day at 4:30 a.m. They also take college-level classes such as auto mechanics and financial management.</p><p>Duggar, 27, will lean on his faith during the process, too. Guests are obligated to type out a “need or request” from God, pray about the testimony, and share it with others at the facility. During his time, Duggar will also face his issues head-on with counsel groups, and study the Bible.</p><p>“Each new camp director is trained in how to present the messages in convicting yet caring ways, which are intended to encourage the students toward program participation,” the website reads. “A hearer that is a doer is always an overcomer.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight,</a> men at Reformers Unanimous sleep in “military-style barracks” and do 40 hours of community service a week. “Please understand that if you do not work as unto the Lord, you will not remain in the home,” the website says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Duggar won’t have too much contact with his family, either. The controversial reality star can only make one call per week on Monday nights after finishing the first 10 days of treatment. Duggar’s communication with loved ones will be monitored, and only after 60 days will he receive approved weekends with them away from the facility. They are not allowed to send him items such as credit cards, music, pornography, or cash.</p><p>“We love the Duggar family,” Tony Richardson, Director of Development at Reformers Unanimous, told ET last week, adding that the center has an 80 percent success rate. “Our hearts and prayers are with them.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKCnq5mZsm62zqyfZpylnLSivtJmqZ6gkZd6tMDAsmSboZKhsm6%2F066bsmWTpMKvv8SlZKCqn6q9tHnAp5tmpZ%2Bnsm5%2Bj2psbHE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
