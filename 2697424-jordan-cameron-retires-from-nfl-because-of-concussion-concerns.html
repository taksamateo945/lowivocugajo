"You can't play football like that."</p><p>The 28-year-old Cameron looked like a budding star early in his career. The <a href=#>Cleveland Browns</a> made him a fourth-round pick out of USC in 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>After suffering a concussion late in the 2012 season that kept him sidelined for two games, Cameron had a breakout season with the Browns in 2013. He finished second on the team in receptions (80), receiving yards (917) and receiving touchdowns (seven), trailing only Josh Gordon in each category, and was named to the Pro Bowl.</p><p>Cameron signed a two-year deal with the <a href=#>Miami Dolphins</a> in 2015. He only appeared in three games last season after suffering a concussion on September 25 against the Browns.</p><p>"If I didn't get concussions, I'd probably keep playing," Cameron told McManamon. "It's one of those things. I can't risk my mental health in the future. I don't have any symptoms now. I'm perfectly fine. But they can't tell me with 100 percent certainty that if I keep playing and I get more concussions, that I'm going to be OK."</p><p>Cameron also said one reason for his decision to retire is a desire to be there for his eight-year-old son and his hope to have more kids in the future.</p><p>He also said a neurologist cleared him to play again, but the risks were too great for him to continue his career.&nbsp;</p><p>Cameron finished his career with 173 receptions, 2,046 yards and 14 touchdowns in 66 games for the Browns and Dolphins.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9xZ2l%2FdXnJqKmdmZ5isKK5xKump2WimsGqvsSsZJ%2Bqn6J6r7LLZpmem5GqwKZ5zp9knKeemMK0v8iopWabn6Owpr7NrA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
