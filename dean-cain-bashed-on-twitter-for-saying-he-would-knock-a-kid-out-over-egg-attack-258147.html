The Superman alum is trending on social media but it is not for his acting talent.</p><p>It all began with a viral video of Australian Senator Fraser Anning. The senator was speaking at a public event when a teen protestor, who was filming the speech from behind, smacked an egg on Anning’s head.</p><p>The prank did not go over well with the senator, who immediately turned around and punched the kid. His reaction started a chain of events leading to a serious scuffle between the older man and teenager. A group of guys had to break up the fight.</p><p><a href=#>Social media went crazy</a> over the footage. Several were supportive of the boy and opposed the right-winged Anning Islamophobic views and anti-immigration stance. However, it was Cain’s reaction that has sent Twitter into a frenzy.</p><p>https://twitter.com/Henry_Belot/status/1106790914414919681</p><p>“I would have knocked that kid cold,” wrote the former Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman star.</p><p>Now that is enough to get Twitter in an uproar. However, the 52-year-old did not stop there. His next remark is what truly pushed the social media users to attack him.</p><p>“He would have been unconscious if it were up to me,” Cain Tweeted as a follow up to his first response.</p><p>People were angered by the actor’s words and they did not hold back on calling him out. Even though he went on a blocking spree, literally blocking anyone who called him out, the damage had been done. He was enemy number one on Twitter.</p><p>“Oh Dean Cain. I forgot you existed and it turns out that was a good thing,” wrote @oldbiddyyelling</p><p>“I hope Dean Cain gets egged at every convention he attends now we know he’s a garbage human.” Tweeted @gspro15198</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Well Dean Cain blocked me. Please send him this and tell him captain america at least isn't a coward <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/q3Qyf51nmN</a></p><p>— Rob Slop (@couchesrob) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 17, 2019</a></p><p>“Dean Cain’s so tough he’s legit blocking everyone who disagrees with him,” posted @xxxcathyxxx</p><p>Twitter was not happy with Dean Cain saying he would knock a teen protestor unconscious. Social media might have forgiven him and moved on.</p><p>However, he decided to block anyone who disagreed with him, which only pissed off Twitter users. Looks like playing a superhero on television did nothing to help him be a superhero in real life.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>One-time fans are angry and even calling for convention organizers to boycott the actor. It is too much or what Cain deserves after his Twitter remarks and childish blocking behavior?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUmq6vecKaoKdlkpbAqbHDZqanZaSstrXAxKtkn6eiYsCixcinnmaglWLEsMHLnWSkpp%2BYuG6tjKSgnWWfqsFuu9WeqWadl5x6osDTmpqkZWJqhXKAlmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
