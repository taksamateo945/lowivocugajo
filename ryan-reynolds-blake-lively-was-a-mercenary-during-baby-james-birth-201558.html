Reynolds and Lively welcomed their first child together in late December.</p><p>"Right now she's starting to say 'mama,'" he dished. "There's an unfair advantage there. It turns out that breasts are actually a life support system and the child seems to gravitate towards the breasts. I'm just the breastless a–hole wandering around the room and getting in her sightline every once in a while."</p><p>"All about mom. I am dead to her," Reynolds, in head-to-toe Salvatore Ferragamo, joked about his baby girl. "That's her first words, ironically. 'You're dead to me.'"</p><p>The Green Lantern hunk also revealed what it was like when Lively gave birth. "I was there in the delivery room. I mean, I was there for the conception of the child, so I thought the least I could do is be there in the delivery room," he dished. "I'm not going to lie to you… I saw things. But, amazing!"</p><p>In fact, Lively deserves a medal, according to her husband. "My wife is the real, I mean she is a mercenary," Reynolds gushed. "At one point in the middle of the delivery, the doctor's cell phone went off and she said, 'Oh, no. Go ahead, take a personal call. Feel free.' She was cracking jokes in the delivery room. She may have been on drugs, but I don't ask personal questions."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Reynolds said he sort of helped out in the delivery room. "I was just a terrible coach," he confessed. "There was a lot of clapping. I went for a couple of high fives, but she did not."</p><p>Like her husband did on Conan, Lively gushed about first-time parenthood <a href=#>in the May issue of Allure</a>. "I feel like I've figured out the most important thing to me," Lively, 27, said of being a mom. "And everything supports that."</p><p>The Age of Adaline actress — who shared <a href=#>a breastfeeding photo</a> last month via Instagram — joked that it was a "full-time job." Lively added, "I'm like, driving down the road, pumping."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpKilo2S7psPSaKmymZ5iv6bFzaijnatdl7mit8Rmo6KulaHGbsPArGSaZZ2av6SxzZqpsmWUqr%2BqusZmmZqaqWK3ornErGSboaKptW5%2Bj2psbnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
