So, it’s hard for us to visualize Culley as a family man, considering his active lifestyle. But, he has defied the odds by being a loving husband to his spouse and doting father to his children.</p><p>David Culley’s wife, <strong>Carolyn</strong> <strong>Culley</strong>, is a lovely lady who supports her husband’s career. Alongside running a household, she is associate director for strategy and success.
