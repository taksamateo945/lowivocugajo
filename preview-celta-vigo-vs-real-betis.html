However, results elsewhere means that their late push for European qualification has come to an end.</p><p>Since the arrival of Coudet in November 2020, Vigo have earned 46 points in 28 La Liga matches, the same as Saturday’s opponents Real Betis; this total has only been surpassed by the current top four in the division.</p><p>Celta have only won one of their last 11 league meetings with Betis, a 3-2 victory in Balaidos in January 2018. Securing all three points this weekend would be their 15th win of the campaign moving them onto 56 points, their highest total in five years.</p><p class=imgI><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sm.imgix.net/21/06/manuel-pellegrini.jpg title="Real Betis manager Manuel Pellegrini pictured in October 2020" alt="Real Betis manager Manuel Pellegrini pictured in October 2020" width=640 height=480 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=article_img_copyright_body><span class=article_img_copyright>© Reuters</span></span></p><p>Real Betis kept their hopes of qualifying for the Europa League alive when they narrowly beat Huesca 1-0 last weekend.</p><p>A penalty converted by <strong class=autotag>Borja Iglesias</strong> just before the hour mark was enough for the hosts to seal all three points and stay in sixth place, above Villarreal based on their head-to-head record, despite the Yellow Submarine having an +18 better goal difference.</p><p><strong class=autotag>Manuel Pellegrini</strong>‘s side have made themselves difficult to beat in recent months and have now extended their unbeaten run to 10 La Liga matches, their longest unbeaten streak within a single top-flight campaign since November 2004 under former boss <strong class=autotag>Lorenzo Serra Ferrer</strong>.</p><p>However, seven of these 10 games have been drawn, including each of their last four away from home.
