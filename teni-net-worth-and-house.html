Teni, who has various music uploads on the platform, is seen to have 149,897 fans and will make a good sum of money from there.</p><h4><strong>Google Play</strong></h4><p>The pay from Google Play for artists is dependent on the country where the streams and plays are coming from. It is also dependent on the listeners if they are paid or free. Due to the restrictions, the platform does not have a fixed amount paid to artists but pays roughly 0.0676 per stream. Though her earnings on the platform are unknown, it still adds to her net worth.</p><h4><strong>Audiomack</strong></h4><p>The royalties earned from the platform are calculated by revenue per stream. The calculation of views is determined by dividing the total streams gotten on the platform by the revenue from subscriptions and advertisements. Following the calculations, Teni makes money on the platform from the number of streams of her content. The number of streams is multiplied by 50% of the revenue per stream, which is the AMP revenue share.</p><p>The singer joined the platform on October 1, 2019, and has become an A-list artist on the platform.
