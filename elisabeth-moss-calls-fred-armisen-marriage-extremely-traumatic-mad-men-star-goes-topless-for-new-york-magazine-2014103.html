The Mad Men star, who reprises her role as Peggy Olson in the <a href=#>upcoming seventh season</a> of the hit AMC series, opened up about her short-lived marriage to <strong>Fred Armisen</strong> in a new interview.</p><p>Wearing nothing but a pair of skin-baring denim overalls on the cover of <a href=#>New York Magazine</a>, the petite brunette actress, 31, told the mag in its March 10 issue that her marriage experience was "extremely traumatic."</p><p>"Looking back, I feel like I was really young, and at the time I didn't think that I was that young," Moss said of her relationship with Saturday Night Live star Armisen, which ended in divorce in 2010 after just eight months together. "It was extremely traumatic and awful and horrible," she continued.</p><p>Since their divorce, Armisen <a href=#>gave a frank interview</a> to <strong>Howard Stern</strong> in January 2013 in which he admitted to being a "terrible husband." (The SNL and Portlandia star, now 47, has been married and divorced three times.)</p><p>Armisen's comments came close to one year after his ex-wife gave a 2012 interview about how he treated her during their marriage. "One of the greatest things I heard someone say about him is, 'He's so great at doing impersonations. But the greatest impersonation he does is that of a normal person.'" she shared of the performer.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite the tumultuous history with her ex, Moss has since reclaimed her power starring on the award-winning historical drama series. Back in January, the star took home a <a href=#>Best Actress Golden Globe</a> for her performance as Olson opposite <a href=#><strong>Jon Hamm</strong></a>'s Don Draper. "At the same time, it turned out for the best," Moss told NY Mag. "I'm glad that I'm not there. I'm glad that it didn't happen when I was 50. I'm glad I didnâ€™t have kids. And I got that out of the way. Hopefully. Like, that's probably not going to happen again."</p><p>Despite being tabloid fodder herself post-divorce, Moss added in her interview that she ultimately understood why America was so intrigued by stars. "I enjoy a little gossip," she confessed. "I like looking at photos of celebrities going to Starbucks."</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: what do you think of Moss' topless overalls cover?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OyuL%2BOnqOiq5GXsrW0jKamrKtdmK6tuNJmnaudlGKus7nIrJynZZ2Wv7O1wKCcZp2oqb%2BmucSlsGasopbCrq3ToppmpZGZeq6xzWaqrZmiYrSwsdJmq6ionJrAtHnFqKlmppWserq70aRkppmXlsequsRmaWlpZGZ9dA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 GleamVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
